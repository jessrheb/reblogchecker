## Usage

Reblog Checker will scan all of your posts and save their root IDs for as long as you keep the tab open. When you feed it the link to the Tumblr post you're not sure has been reblogged before, Reblog Checker will extract its root ID and look into your posts's saved root IDs for a match. In case there is a match, Reblog Checker will provide you with the link to your reblog.

1. In step one, provide the username of the blog you want to search and wait until all of your posts are processed.
2. In step two, provide the link to the post you want to check, then click the "Check!" button. Make sure that the link is in a valid format (e.g. `https://username.tumblr.com/post/123456789101112` or `https://www.tumblr.com/username/123456789101112`).
